# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-Prediction
## Project Overview
The purpose of this Analysis is to preemptively manage the expected increase in electricity demand during the summer months for the energy company (eSC) operating in South Carolina and parts of North Carolina and relieve the strain on the electrical grid during these high-demand periods without having to build new energy-generating facilities.The emphasis is on identifying the fundamental determinants that influence energy use, developing predictive models to forecast peak energy demand, and devising strategies to encourage energy saving among residential consumers.

## Project Outcomes
- Data Collection and Preparation
- Analysis of Energy Consumption 
- Predictive Modeling for Demand Forecasting 
- Interactive Data Visualization with Shiny Apps 

### Predictive models used:
- Linear Regression Model
- XGBoost Model

## Conclusion
The project successfully highlighted the critical factors affecting residential energy consumption and developed predictive models to forecast energy usage. The findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions such as upgrading insulation and lighting to reduce energy consumption. These insights and recommendations can help utility providers and policymakers implement more effective energy management strategies, promoting sustainability and reducing the strain on energy infrastructures during peak periods.
